This task-based productivity tool is meant to encourage users to accomplish daily, weekly, or even monthly tasks via the gamification of said tasks. On the main page, at the very top, you will find a streak counter, and below that you will find a list of all your completed and uncompleted tasks. To add a task, click the add task button and fill out the necessary information. Then you can return to the main page and click on said task in order to mark it as complete or lock in to what we call focus mode.  Next to the add task button is the Hatpedia, which the user can then use to take all the points they accumulated from completing tasks in order to customize their avatar, or "lil guy," with a hat, all of which have an accompanying description. The last button is the stats button, which just displays all the stats that one has accumulated from using the app. We hope you enjoy and can find great utility in this app.
